# Kit

This is the source code for Kit, one of the LavaLab groups for F16. 

As millenials move away from traditional beauty outlets like television and magazines, they're looking for new ways to engage with brands through influencers, and generic platforms like YouTube and Pinterest aren't cutting it. Kit is a mobile app that helps beauty enthusiasts discover new products, find inspiration, and become part of a global community.

The code here is for our prototype for display on demo day. As a result, the code here is not high quality or ready for production. For demo day, we wanted to display the capabilities of Kit for one user (Vanessa Qin, one of our awesome team members). As a result, this code is not yet ready for additional users.
